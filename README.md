This is a Java implementation of a basic library management.
Here in this project I tried to show Abstraction with an abstract Book class,
Inheritance with Fiction and NonFiction subclasses,
Encapsulation within the Library class, and
Polymorphism through method overriding in the displayDetails() method.
